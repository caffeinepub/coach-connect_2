The hero, services, about, testimonials, and contact form sections are all implemented with appropriate content and functionality. The backend properly handles contact form submissions with validation and storage. The warm, professional visual theme is consistently applied using terracotta, sage, and peachy tones throughout the design. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
